class AlignmentNetwork(nn.Module, ABC):
    """
    This is the base class for a neural network used for alignment-related experiments. 

    The point of all the wrangling of standard torch workflows in this class is to make 
    it easy to perform all the alignment-related computations for networks with different
    architectures without having to rewrite similar code over and over again. In this way,
    the user only needs to add a layer type to the **LAYER_REGISTRY** in this file and
    then alignment methods can be automatically applied. 

    The forward method of **AlignmentNetwork** passes the input (*x*) through each registered
    layer of the network in order of it's registration. If hidden activations are requested, then
    the output of each registered layer is saved. The alignment methods are applied to the 
    hidden activation at the output of layer L-1 and the weights of layer L. 

    Note: some shape wrangling (like that which happens between a convolutional layer and a
    linear layer are often treated as a nn.Module layer), but these don't require alignment-
    related processing. To use these, set 'ignore' of the metaparameters to True. Alternatively,
    you can append them to the last component of a layer.

    Note: the choice of where to put layers matters. I usually nest a dropout in a sequential
    layer in front of whatever layer is relevant for alignment, because then the previous 
    hidden outputs will be measured before using dropout. Of course, this may not be desired,
    it's just about your scientific question. 

    A layer in the layer_registry should have the following properties:
    1. Be a child of the nn.Module class with a forward method
    2. Have at most one "relevant" processing stage with weights for measuring alignment
